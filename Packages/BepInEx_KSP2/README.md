## BepInEx Framework

This is the pack of all the things you need to both start using mods, and start making mods using the BepInEx framework.

### What each folder is for:

-   `BepInEx/plugins` - This is where normal mods/plugins are placed to be loaded. If a mod is just a `NAME.dll` file, it probably goes in here. For your own organisation, consider putting them inside folders, eg: `plugins/ActualRain/ActualRain.dll`

-   `BepInEx/patchers` - These are more advanced types of plugins that need to access Mono.Cecil to edit .dll files during runtime. Only copy paste your mods here if the author tells you to.

-   `BepInEx/config` - If your plugin has support for configuration, you can find the config file here to edit it.

-   `BepInEx/core` - Core BepInEx .dll files, you'll usually never want to touch these files (unless you're updating manually)
